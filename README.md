A very simply drawing program that I doodled together while on vacation at the beach. 
Currently supports black, red and blue colors. To draw, hold the SHIFT key and use the arrow keys. 
Select desired color from the colors dropdown menu. 

To compile the program:

javac Draw.java

To run the program:

java Draw


***TO DO***
I absolutely MUST implement a clear screen functionality and/or an eraser.
