Very basic drawing/sketch program written in Java that resembles the old Etch A Sketch toys for kids in the 90's. 
Currently supports black, red and blue colors. To draw, hold the SHIFT key and use the arrow keys. 
Select desired color from the colors dropdown menu. 

To compile the program:

javac Draw.java

To run the program:

java Draw
